we have what they took and what they need to taken
Steps:
- Ask user their current semester and graduating semester
    - Drop down with 
- Ask user for co-op cycle (Fall or Spring)
- Make sure that all preqs of courses are put down first 
- Make sure that all coreqs are accounted for each class
- Keep a max of 19 credits for reg semester and 10 credits for summer semester



if we wanna be extra extra, we can ask them if they want a specific class 
in a specific semester and build a schedule around those preferences 
(probably won't be able to do this) 

use past TRACE evals to determine the likelihood of a course being offered in 
a certain semester, and rearrange courses to fit that as well
